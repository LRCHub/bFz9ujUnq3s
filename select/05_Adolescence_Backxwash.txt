I know I haven't called but I love you bro
I hope you understand that this is how I didn't think I'll plan this
I'm damaged my fear is how I navigate the planet
If I stopped myself from talking I will stop your friends from laughing
Im putting salt up in the bandage
I'm walking with a lasso on the stage as I Rope-a-dope the only hope
I have im hoping i won't overdose, i'm too old for the 27 club
I'm a total joke
I just hope you doing better I can't really get on the phone right now
Im scared and I'm supposed to be the big older sister not remotely close
I'm just trying not to break down at once if you know you know
I guess maybe I should go to therapy
Cause keeping it inside is something that is eating me alive
I don't think that I will die, I aint living to survive
If you can see me you would see it my eyes but fuck
